# About course
Hello everyone, my name is Vadim. I have been programming for over four years.
I've been writing in Java, PHP, Python, and other languages but eventually came to a language called Kotlin.
I consider it one of the best programming languages,
which has a great present and an even better future.

I decided to make my own small Kotlin course for beginners since there are not many courses
on the Internet.

:::info Information
We also have a telegram channel with news - [@kotlincourses](https://t.me/kotlincourses).
There you will find up-to-date information about the knowledge
(changes and new topics, for example).

And also chat - [@kotlincoursechat](https://t.me/kotlincoursechat), where you can ask
anything about the course or kotlin (if something is not clear).

If you're interested in my activity in general, I welcome you to my
personal [Telegram-channel] (https://t.me/vadimmeta).
