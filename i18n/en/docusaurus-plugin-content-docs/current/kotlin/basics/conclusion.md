# Conclusion: Tasks
In this part of the course, we considered a lot of basic topics, which are already quite a significant factor in the 
study Kotlin and other languages as well (because, usually, languages do not differ 
much in this respect, except, of course, for different syntax and idioms).

Before moving on to studying the following topics, I advise you to practice solving some problems that are related to what we have considered this time.

:::info Task #1
Create a simple calculator consisting of the following
input: integer, action (a string that can contain +, -, /, *) and
another number with a comma.
Input example ('>' means new input line):

\> 10

\> -

\> 9.99

0.0099999999999999787
:::

:::info Task #2
Create a program that accepts a number from 1 to 12, which
corresponds to the month by its serial number. Print to screen
month name and season name.
:::

:::info Task #3
Create a program that will calculate the sum of arithmetic
progression (the sum of elements of the range from zero to the entered
user values) without loops or recursions.
:::

:::info Task #4
The variable min, the value of which was entered by the user, contains a number
from 0 to 59. Determine in which quarter of an hour this number falls (y
first, second, third or fourth). Print the result.
:::

:::info Task #5
Create a program that checks for multiples of three all numbers from
1 to 100.
:::

:::info Task #6
Create a program that displays the multiplication table from 1 to 9
using a loop.
Hint: you need to make a nested loop (loop within a loop).
:::

:::info Task #7
Create a program where user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
Limit the number of attempts to 7, and on each failed attempt, answer the user whether the random number is greater or less.
:::


It is very important to practice, so I advise you to do it immediately after reading.
