# Introduction
My respect, dear friends! My name is Vadim, from today I will tell you about Kotlin, so let's start with the simple: what is Kotlin, why Kotlin and more.
### What is Kotlin?
**Kotlin** is a statically typed object-oriented programming language and blah blah blah. We will not bore you and will go straight to the main point.
### Why Kotlin?
Before we begin our excursion into the world of Kotlin development, it would not hurt to say that there are no perfect programming languages. You will not be able to learn Kotlin alone and be a really in-demand specialist. Each programming language solves some problem: starting with ease of learning and use, ending with any other toolkit. What problem does Kotlin solve - I will tell you now.

The main advantage of Kotlin over other programming languages is its isolation from the environment. Kotlin works without problems in various ecosystems: *JVM* (where, for example, such programming languages ​​as Java or Scala exist), Web (can be compiled in JS or WebAssembly), Desktop (compiled in C++) and on mobile devices (Android , iOS).

What does it mean? It means that Kotlin will continuously help to solve different tasks.
By learning Kotlin, you will be able to cover all the currently popular platforms. It also means that you can, for example, work with code written in other programming languages ​​(Desktop - C++; JVM, Android - Java; iOS - Swift / Objective-C and, of course, Web - JS / WASM).

Also, Kotlin is very simple and consistent. Come on, let's get down to business!
### What is the structure of the course?
If I still interested you, let's consider how our course will go with you.
When studying, we will use the following rules:
- We create a problem: in order to explain what is needed for what, let's create a problem and solve it.
- Theory: before proceeding to the solution, let's consider the theoretical part.
- We solve the problem: we learn the theory and solve our problem.
- Try it yourself: we leave the opportunity for you to practice.

These are the main principles of the course. I will not explain something new, but I will try to explain clearly.
